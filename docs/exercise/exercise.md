## Project delivery <to be filled by student>

How to start the project: (if other than `grailsw run-app`)

How to test the project:  (if other than `grailsw test-app`)

Hand-written, static HTML 
project description:      (if other than `index.html` in project root directory)

External contributions:
The workshop 3 materials helped me to know how layout my pages in a way to make the page cleaner and more responsive.
StackOverflow and ws3 illustrations were also a great help to me, to get inspired and learn new tricks and ideas.


Other comments:
I loved what i've done, and i feel satisfied with how it looks and functions. I am a bit frustrated because i couldn't 
do the exactly what i've imagined at the beginning because of my small experience with html and Java script. yet i think
that i've learned a lot from what i've done in this project.   

I'm particular proud of:
The simplicity of the website and also my bug fixing. I closed a lot of bugs, which may have led the website to collapse
and stops functioning.   


## Project grading 

Valid description HTML, even though a closing </p> is missing and some
spelling errors ("wizh"?).

The application works nicely.
It includes some interactivity and validation (while the use of "alert"
should not be overdone, esp. when you have multiple constraint violations),
multiple question types with in-place UI change between them,
statistics view is basic.

Git log is decent. Could be a bit more fine-granular.

grailsw test-app: 9 tests completed, 4 failed.
Some good unit tests, no integration tests.

HTML validation on the app pages shows some minor issues.
But good use of semantic elements, therefore full points.

Comments and naming is good. 
Views make no use of composition and therefore accrue some duplication.

Since you hit the ceiling anyway, I spare the effort of grading 
extra points. But I have to say, that I very much like the 
clear, focussed simplicity of the UI and the straightforward way that
you used the WebMVC. 
But one can always improve. In your case I would strive to learn ways
in which you can avoid too many nesting levels (if, for, etc.) of your code.

Grade: 6.0.
Congratulations!
